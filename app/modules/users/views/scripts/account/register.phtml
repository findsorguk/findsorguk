    <p>
        By applying for a user account for the Portable Antiquities Database, you must agree to abide by the following
        conditions.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            You will not reveal your password to any one else.
        </li>
        <li>
            You will not allow anyone other than yourself to use your account (for example, do not log on for another
            person to use the database.)
        </li>
        <li>
            You are bound by the Data Protection Act, not to distribute any of the personal data held within the
            database.
        </li>
        <li>
            You must not contact any of the finders named on the database, without firstly liaising with the regional
            Finds Liaison Officer for that area. Namely, if you want to speak to Mr X. based in Suffolk, you must
            contact the Suffolk Finds Liaison Officer in the first instance.
        </li>
        <li>
            It is a priority that find spot information should be as accurate as possible and therefore you should not
            record material where there is doubt about it's provenance unless there are strong reasons for doing so.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Portable Antiquities Scheme reserves the right to revoke your license to use the database at anytime.
            This can be reinstated, on appeal to the Central Unit, if investigation reveals that there are grounds for
            this.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you wish to use the data recorded on the system for publication purposes, you must, in the first instance
            contact the Central Unit for permission to do so. This will be granted on a case by case basis. Therefore,
            you must ask for permission for each instance that you will be using the data.
        </li>
        <li>
            Images recorded on the system, remain the copyright of the named person, held within the meta - data. The
            Scheme embraces open access, and therefore disseminates material under a Creative Commons By Attribution
            licence. You can opt out of this when entering images, but we hope you do not decide to do this.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you want an account for research purposes, then the scheme will need documentation proving your
            accreditation, and a full description of your research agenda.A letter or email from your supervisor or
            institution will usually suffice.<br/>
            If you are an independent researcher, then a letter or email outlining your research methodology will be
            accepted instead, along with a reference from either your publisher or an academic institution that is
            prepared to guarantee your good character.<br/>
            If you are unaffiliated, try to find a referee of archaeological standing, or speak to one of our Finds
            Adviser
            team for advice.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>I agree to abide by the conditions outlined above.</p>
